SQLite.XM is a SQLite wrapper written in C# and designed to be used with Xamarin based mobile applications. SQLite.XM makes using SQLite with Xamarin a snap. 

SQLite.XM shields your application from the details of working directly with SQLite. Instead, you app interfaces with a higher level layer that provides database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality, in addition to providing an abstraction layer that greatly simplifies retrieving records from a search. SQLite.XM also takes care of initializing your apps schema, performing schema updates, managing resources, and synchronizing data to a server-side database.
