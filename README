This library is intended for mobile app developers that are using or intend to use the Xamarin framework and want to learn how to use SQLite.XM. 

SQLite.XM is a SQLite wrapper written in C# and designed to be used with Xamarin based mobile applications. SQLite.XM makes using SQLite with Xamarin a snap. It shields your application from the details of working directly with SQLite. Instead, you app interfaces with a high level layer that provides database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality, in addition to providing an abstraction layer that greatly simplifies retrieving records from a search. SQLite.XM also takes care of initializing your apps schema, performing schema updates and synchronizing data to a server-side database.
